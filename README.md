### Build a Code Editor Workshop Guide:

This workshop will teach you how to build a code editor using [monaco editor](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/), an open source library maintained by Microsoft and is the core engine that powers VS Code
 
 By the end of this workshop you'll have a better understanding of how modern code editors work behind the scene and make your own customized code editor

### Prerequisites
> **Basic familiarity with the following concepts**
 1. [Online IDE ecosystem](https://www.dlvhdr.me/posts/online-ides-ecosystem)
 1. [Working with web workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers)
 2. [Language server protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) (because why not)

### Getting Started
  1. Star this repository so I know you have taken this workshop! ðŸ˜„
  2. Use this repository as a template (should appear in the main repository page)
  3. Clone the generated repository to your local machine
  4. cd and run `yarn start`

### Tasks
> **Complete as many tasks as possible**
  1. Assign a default text and change the editor language to `typescript`
  2. Pimp your editor with some custom styles and behavior (full set of options [here](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/api/interfaces/monaco.editor.IStandaloneEditorConstructionOptions.html))
  3. Create a new customized theme and replace the built-in one
  4. Add an action that duplicates the current line (attach the shortkey <kbd>âŒ˜</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd>)
  5. Support the following in code completion :
     * Snippet for `superduperlog` that will execute
       ```js
       console.log("==========");
       console.log();
       console.log("==========");
       ```
       and set the cursor in the middle log command
     * add the global variable `$` with different apis
  6. Load external type definitions into the code editor, any `d.ts` will do
  7. Multiple file support (don't go too hard on file navigation, simply have two or more files and allow swapping between them somehow)
  8. Experiment with some more language features that monaco provides (code lens, highlights etc)
  9. Got that far? ðŸ˜® Here are some advanced features you could implement
    * Integrate a new web worker that handles eslint/any static analysis to the code
    * Customize the out-of-the-box typescript worker with custom functionality
    * Go to definition
    * Other cool stuff
